### Grade explanation (Personal Development)
I think for technical skills I am on the advanced level. I have done all the needed activities and challenges which can be seen at [results](results).
Besides the needed activities and outcomes I also added some activities and challenges like my personal project [P4wnP1](/results/p4wnp1) and my work on my [secure lab environment at home](/results/lab)
But I have also helped multiple of my teammates with the work they did not understand yet and helped them fix the issues they were having. For confirmation Thomas van Heel and JoÃ«l Adams can be asked.

Technical Red teaming skills are related to (IT) security technical skills, such as (but not limited to): hacking techniques (scripting, enumeration, privesc, pivoting, covert channels, exploitation, cracking, ...), physical security (locks, physical access tokens), offensive hardware (rubber ducky, dropbox, etc.), different target platforms (IoT, OT, mobile, ..) and environments (Windows, Linux, Android, ...).

{:.geh}
### Grade explanation (Technical skills)
I have done a lot of work on expanding my red teaming technical skills. I have learned a lot of hacking techniques from [Hack the Box](/results/htb) where I also learned how to target different platforms(Windows, Linux, OpenBSD), physical security aspects and offensive hardwared from using: P4wnp1, wifi pineapple, rubber ducky, packet squirrel and dropbox which I described in [P4wnP1](/results/p4wnp1) and [Tooling](/results/tooling). I also did IoT security testing described in [R&D Project](project).

<hr>

Procedural red teaming skills are related to working in a structured way and reporting activity and results.
Working in a structured way: using proven (real world) methods/phases to perform pentests and red teaming operations, planning activities by considering efficiency combined with risk of damage and exposure. Working with written consent, ethically,  and in close cooperation with white team to prevent accidents.
Reporting activity and results:  written report to client/blue team/development (accompanied with a presentation), registering performed red teaming activity (was it a red teamer or a malicious actor?), documenting security tests (secure code review report, what is and isn't tested). Written responsible disclosure and PoCs. Knowledge sharing with peers in the field (informal, online, conferences). 

{:.geh}
### Grade explanation (Procedural skills)
For Procedural skills I think I am at proficient. I have done writeups of boxes in [Hack the Box](/results/htb). I also have done a pentest where I will have done a phising test at a company where we comminicated a test plan and written consent which are described in [Wever](/results/wever). I also done a written report for the [Red vs Blue team events](redvsblue). I have done some knowledge sharing by helping others with making the Red vs Blue team pentest report. I could improve this by making a secure code review report for maybe the R&D Project.
