# Results
As a result of this minor I have been able to demonstrate many things. But also tried many things that interested me a lot.
Below I will briefly tell you about the things I have done with possibly a link to the detailed explanation and evidence.

## [Hack The Box](htb)
I started this semester with Hack The Box, where I made 2 writeups of active boxes myself. I have also been working on fortress (Jet). And I learned a lot with Hack The Box challenges.

## [Pentests](pentests)
I have conducted several pentests this semester in [R&D Project](project) you can read more about that specific pentest. I will also tell you more about the other pentests I have done: about the project of [Marc van Bommel](https://marcvanbommel.github.io/) and possibly about the pentest for a company.

## [Tooling](tooling)
I have also been working on p4wnp1 about this I gave a lecture at red teaming. I also wrote several payloads for this and made them easily available. I've also written a guide to turn the p4wnp1 into a dropbox.

## P4wnp1(p4wnp1)
I have a raspberry pi zero w where I 3d printed a case for and on which I run [P4wnp1 aloa](https://github.com/RoganDawes/P4wnP1_aloa) so I can use it as a hid hacking tool but also as a dropbox. I have written several payloads for this. I also have an explanation of how I made the P4wnp1 function as a dropbox.
