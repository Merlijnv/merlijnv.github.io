# Pentests
For this semester I have done several pen tests that I will tell about below.
If you want to know more about the R&D Pentests you can find it [here](project).

## Blue vs Red team events
For the Blue vs Red teaming events I made the discord channel for it.
For every group I made a role and made multiple channels that could be usefull for the event.


## Marc van Bommel
Here I tell about pentest of security engineer student.

## Company
Together with a classmate of mine we tought it would be really interesting to do a pentest for a company.
We got in contact with De Wever and had a conversation on what we could pentest. At the end of the meeting we had 2 things in our scope:
- A phising test
- A external application test
The external application needs to get approval from the other company but the phising test we will do for sure.
You can read about both of these pentests [here](wever)
