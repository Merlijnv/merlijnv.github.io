# Project
## Intersect
![Intersect logo](/images/intersectlogo.png)

The Research and development (R&D) project I am working on this semester is the Intersect project. This project is a set of guidelines for IoT devices within Smart industry, Smart mobility, Smart health and Smart city. Intersect is a study that aims to provide more security for IoT devices.

at the beginning of this semester, we had a number of projects to choose from to research. We were asked to make a top three, for me personally intersect was my first choice. IoT is something that has interested me for some time and of which I also see that it is a growing part of our society. My personal objection has always been that most IoT devices are absolutely not secure. To be able to contribute to making the IoT devices safer is of course very interesting.

## Ethical analysis

To get a better picture of the impact of this project, I first made my own ethical analysis. I did this via the TICT tool from fontys. I looked at the Impact of this project on the users, how people can misuse it and at any unintended side effects. This includes the impact on the environment, but also the prejudices that may be part of the project. the full analysis can be found [here](../pdf/TICT.pdf).

## Research approach
In the beginning attention was paid to the research approach. Everyone had to come up with individual sub-questions, main questions and associated methods from the DOT framework. After everyone had done this, we came to one main question with a number of sub-questions. We have looked at all the described methods to achieve a good triangulation.
All of this was put in the [research plan](/pdf/researchplan.pdf).

## Website

As an end product we made a github page to easily share and present our findings and guidelines. 
On this site you find the best practices that you can use in IoT devices and all the cases we found that these best practices could be used.
You can find the website on [fontys-intersect.github.io](https://fontys-intersect.github.io/)
