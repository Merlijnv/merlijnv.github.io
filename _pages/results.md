# Results
As a result of this minor I have been able to demonstrate many things. But also tried many things that interested me a lot.
Below I will briefly tell you about the things I have done with possibly a link to the detailed explanation and evidence.

## [Hack The Box](htb)
I started this semester with Hack The Box, where I made 2 writeups of active boxes myself. I have also been working on fortress (Jet). And I learned a lot with Hack The Box challenges.

## [Pentests](pentests)
I have conducted several pentests this semester in [R&D Project](/project) you can read more about that specific pentest. I will also tell you more about the other pentests I have done: about the Red vs Blue team events and also about the pentest for a company in the health industry.

## [Tooling](tooling)
I have also been working on p4wnp1 I wrote several payloads for this and made them easily available. I've also written a guide to turn the p4wnp1 into a dropbox. More about dropbox you can read [here](dropbox). Besides that I also tested out multiple of the hak5 gear like the wifi pineapple and did some cool stuff with that. You can also read what tools I use on my kali.

## [P4wnp1](p4wnp1)
I have a raspberry pi zero w where I 3d printed a case for and on which I run [P4wnp1 aloa](https://github.com/RoganDawes/P4wnP1_aloa) so I can use it as a hid hacking tool but also as a dropbox. I have written several payloads for this. I also have an explanation of how I made the P4wnp1 function as a dropbox.

## [Lab](lab)
I have a homelab at home where I run my virual machines such as my development server.
Before this semester this was running a setup where all the severs where accessible from my home network devices and vice versa.
But this isn't really secure because when a hacker can compromise one of my servers they have full access to my home network.
I wanted to fix this.

## [CTF advent](advent)
During the december month a ctf has been started that contains multiple cyber ctf challenges which I did.
