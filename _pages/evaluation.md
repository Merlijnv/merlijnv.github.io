# Evaluation and Reflection

I think I really have learned a lot this semester.
I have tinkered with some really interesting stuff.
Like the wifi pineapple with wpa2 cracking but also the p4wnp1.
I also have learned a lot of new technical en procedural skills with red teaming.
I have done a lot of boxes and challenges on hackthebox.

Besides my personal work I am really proud of what my group did for the R&D project.
I think we did some top-notch research and made some good guidelines and best practices for IoT devices.
