# Peer reviews

At the end of each sprint, we look back as a group on the performance of our members. on this page I am going to show the feedback of my fellow students per sprint and write a short article about it.

## Sprint 0

![peerreview sprint 0](/images/peer_review_sprint0.png)

I agree with the general feedback, we need to do a little more knowledge sharing as a group and we have a number of people with strong opinions who can shout a bit harder then the rest. I myself am one of these people and will therefore work on talking more calmly in the coming sprint and asking more for the opinion of calmer group members.

I am happy that the rest of my group agrees with me being the leader and give me great feedback I can work on.

### Actionpoints for sprint 1

- talk more calmly
- ask more opinion from the silent persons in our group

## Sprint 1

I think the general feedback is something we really need to work on.
We have such a big project and with so much people working on it it's really important to share all the knowledge.
I improved my overexplaining but still have some work on it.

### Actionpoints for sprint 2

- knowledge sharing every day with standdown
- keep explanation even shorter and plan discussions outside of standup

## Sprint 2

The group is still happy with me as group leader we are really on schedule and we have 1 sprint left where we mostly are going to work on documentation.
There is no pentesting work we are going to do.
I got some feedback on giving other people more room to speak and I am going to work on that next sprint.

### Actionpoints for sprint 3

- give other people more room to speak in talks with the teacher

## Sprint 3

At the last sprint I have gotten individual feedback from all group members on all learning outcomes.
I did this by making a google form with all the learning outcomes and their levels explained and a tips and a tops field.

You have a lot of knowledge and improved in it as well. |
