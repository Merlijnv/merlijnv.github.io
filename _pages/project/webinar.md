# Webinar
Yearly Intersct organizes a seminar where professors and professionals give talks about the future of IoT devices and their security. This year this was a webinar because of the situation concerning corona. We followed the webinar that was on 14 and 15 October. Here I looked at mostly talks concerning the security of IoT devices because this information could help our project.

## Day 1
The presentation started with the Software Bill of Materials(SBOM) which isn't interesting for our project because it didn't involve security. But I was personally interested in this subject so I still followed it.

The second presentation was about the fact that we can't expect that all consumers of software and hardware are security experts. This would force companies and governments to enforce the security of products to be higher. This presentation didn't contain interesting information in my opinion.

The next subject was DDOS and IoT, This was about how IoT devices could be used to DDOS other devices and what risks this would bring with it. This presentation was more interesting for our project.

For the parallel session, I followed the red teaming presentation. But this presentation was disappointing I expected a lot of useful information also for the IoT testing in our project. But we only got some information on hacking IoT devices on real in-depth hardware which doesn't fit in our products that are in our scope.

## Day 2

The first presentation was really interesting because it was about what we should do with IoT devices until they are safe enough. Most IoT devices come from china which doesn't have safety measures for hardware and software. Who needs to act on these security risks was also a discussion. 

The last presentation that I followed was about the federate labs that do testing on IoT devices which our project is one of the teams that is testing IoT devices.
I hoped to get some interesting information from other labs. But we didn't get any insight into their work only in their way of working.

In general, I think that the webinar was really useful for our project some presentations not so interesting. But I think we got some good information out of it.
