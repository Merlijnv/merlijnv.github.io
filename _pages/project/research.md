# Research

For our research, we used the dot framework as a research framework.
In the [research plan](/pdf/researchplan.pdf) we defined the triangulation we wanted to use.

## Triangulation

We tried to use as much triangulation as we could. This way we researched the question from multiple angles and added some more value to it.

*What vulnerabilities can be found in the Air-quality and smart screen projects?*
_The Air-quality and smart screen are part of our project, we will partially base our guidelines on the results of the vulnerability assessment of these two projects._

We used the following research methods:

- Lab: Security test
- Workshop: Code review
- Showroom: Ethical check

### Lab: Security test

To test out what vulnerabilities could be in general IoT devices we tested devices in our scope. We did security tests for those applications mostly testing out the software. We did this by testing out if there were any vulnerabilities like the Owasp 10.

### Workshop: Code review

To also find out not easy to find vulnerabilities we wanted to do a white box test by looking at the code we found out multiple vulnerabilities a lot easier. We also did fix some code by reviewing it. But this was mostly security code fixes.

### Showroom: Ethical check

We also did an ethical check mainly on how ethical our guidelines are because our research is supported by certain products in our scope. But if we share all the vulnerabilities with their name on them. We endanger the companies that have these vulnerabilities. So we took that into account when deciding how to present our findings of these vulnerabilities. To accomplish a good overview of all the ethical dangers we made a [TICT report](/pdf/TICT.pdf)
