For the password for the writeups check canvas.

## Fortress
After having done multiple boxes with different difficulties I also wanted to try fortress as a challenge. This is a machine made by a company with multiple flags and not only user and root flags.

## Challenges
After the ctf I got more interest in the challenges. I learned multiple new tools which are really interesting for the challenges.

## Achievements
I have begon this semester with no hackthebox experience I only created a account before but never did something with it (I already regret that). But since then I learned a lot of real life hacking scenarios and  how to tackle them. I have done alot of boxes easy hard and even insane I also tried fortress.

I have come in the top of Netherland user ranking of Hack the Box. I am currently nr 31/691 of and I am planning to get even higher.
I am rank 609 of the global ranking.

# HTB x Uni CTF 2020
In the weekend of 20-22 november we participated on the ctf of hackthebox with a team of 10 people with 2 known guests.
I really enjoyed this ctf and learned alot from it mostly some thing on crypto and reversing. I also learned some new tools which I added to my [tooling](/results/tooling).
We started preparing in advance and making a discord to communicate with the team and collaborate with each other on challenges.

I think we did really good and we ended up #77 of 202 with a team that didn't have any ctf experience except hackthebox itself.
