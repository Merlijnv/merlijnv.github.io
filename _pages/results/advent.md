# Advent ctf

In the december month there was a really interesting ctf advent calendar.
I started later on in the advent calendar on day 7.
On my first day I did challenge 0-4.

## Challenge 0

The teaser site huh after looking for a teaser site I tried way back machine.
There was 1 other date in the way back machine.
In the code there was a encryption.

After using cyber chef and letting it convert it from base64 I got the answer.

## Challenge 1

This time we need a password.
My first thought was would there be a hidden code in the html like challenge 0.
And there it was.

Again trying it in cyber chef and it works.
