# Learning plan

In this page I will do the following.

- Describe the skills (technical, procedural, attitude, soft skills) and experience that you want to get this semester.
- Describe your learning wishes and goals for this semester, with a global explanation of the learning activities you are going to do.
- Add a prioritised and planned list of the learning activities. Use this planning to track and manage your progress. Have this list approved by your coach and specialisation teacher.

## Skills

I will describe which skills I want to learn this semester. I will not only talk about technical skills. I will also talk about my professional development, procedural and soft skills. Based on these skills I will start planning.

### Technical skills

This semester I really want to do more with red teaming. During my specialisation I have learned a lot of ways to take adventage of secuirty flaws. Even tough I have learned all these ways I still have not much experience to go from enumeration to exploitation and infiltration. I want to practice more boxes on hack the box and learn more ways to easily do some red team hacking. Furthemore I really am excited to learn how to reverse engineer. I think this has very much potentional but never learned how to do it.

### Procedural skills


<!-- De procedurele vaardigheden waar ik dit semester aan wil werken zijn het rapporteren en security testing. Aan het rapporteren moet ik werken omdat dit voor mij met mijn dyslectie een lastig onderwerp blijft. Security testing is een nieuw onderwerp voor mij en daarom zal ik daar ook aan moeten werken. -->

### Professional development

<!-- Ik wil dit semester er voor zorgen dat ik meer uit ga van security by design. De veiligheid van internet gerelateerde items wordt een steeds groter topic in de media en wordt hierdoor steeds belangrijk voor bedrijven en overheden. Hierdoor verwacht ik dat werkgevers steeds meer gaan verlangen naar het ontwerpen met de veiligheid als eerste gedachten. -->

### Exercises

- M: Find a couple of red teaming and pen-tester vacancies with job descriptions and analyse what task and skills are described. Add to and update your learning plan as needed.
- S: Complete challenges in all categories on different levels in Hack the Box, see [1].
- M: Experiment with phishing tooling in a controlled, separated  environment (do not send phishing mails without a written consent!)
- S: With a red teaming perspective visit a local building (school, library, store), document your observations AFTERWARDS from a security point of view (people, processes, technology) also reflect on your experience. Act PASSIVELY, don't do anything illegal or anything that could lead to suspicion  or inconvenience: do not make notes or photos, visit rooms you are not supposed to, try fire doors, etc.
- C: Pick a lock. Study the security of physical locks and pick a lock with a lock picking set. See [7] for a starting point.
- S: Learn how to do reversing of smartphone apps (for android, iphone, ...).
- M: Read about covert channels (see e.g. [8][9]), find applications of covert channels in hacking and red teaming, and set-up one or several experimental applications of covert channels
- M: Set up your personal toolbox environments for pen-testing and red teaming.

### Challenges

- M: Own one of the active Linux based machines in Hack the Box and create a write-up of it, see [1].
- M: Own one of the active Windows based machines in Hack the Box and create a write-up of it, see [1].
- C: Perform a pen-test on an (early version of a potentially shippable) product of the security engineering students or blue teaming students.
- M: Set up and perform a pen-test on an (early version of a potentially shippable) product of one of the cyber security R&D project.
- C: Define and publish a pen-testing service for FHICT PII projects that are running in other FHICT minors. See for example service descriptions [2], [3], [4]. Communicate the existence of the service to other programs, projects, PII's. The goal then of course is to set up and perform a pen-test on an iteration product of one of the (other) FHICT PII projects. 
- S: Perform a vulnerability analysis on a (smartphone) app. Report your findings through responsible disclosure.
- C: Perform vulnerability analysis on websites from organizations that have a responsible disclosure disclosure policy. Report your findings through responsible disclosure.
- S: Perform vulnerability analysis on a device (hardware/consumer products). Report your findings through responsible disclosure.
- S: Look into the security of IoT or OT (e.g. PLC) protocols and technology and find and replay one or more hacks or other security incidents in a test environment. 
- C: Develop a dropbox that can be used in red teaming assignments, see [6] as a first staring point.
- M: Prepare towards a Red Team - Blue Team exercise (day/event) with the Security Engineering students and the Blue Team students to attack and test the IT systems and applications developed by the Security Engineering students and the Blue teaming Capabilities of the Blue Teaming students. Test your red teaming skills,  procedures and red team toolbox and environment. Use the experience of the first event to improve your  Red Teaming systems, toolbox, skills, and procedures.
- M: Work on challenge(s) of your personal interest, some ideas are presented during the red-teaming kickoff.

### Alternative options

- C: Get Red Teaming assignments, pen-tests, vulnerability research from partners in education, partners in innovation, other project groups, your personal network.
- S: Visit (online, due to COVID-19) seminars or conferences related to red teaming, hacking, relevant tools, etc.
- C: Organize and set-up an (online) interview with a red teaming specialist.
- S: Organize or join a session to analyze a new vulnerability, exploit or malware with a group of red and blue teamers, and other people that are interested.
- S: Join CTF-events with a couple of other red teaming students, see e.g. [5] https://ctftime.org (Links to an external site.).
- S: Setup a wiki/website/... where students can share interesting resources related to red teaming.
- C: Contribute to the INTERSECT (Links to an external site.) research by demonstrating known or new attack scenario's in 'Smart Energy' applications, for example in electric vehicle charging networks end endpoints/apps/..., smart energy home applications and energy systems, etc.
- Note: You could then also use this as a base for the article that you will write and publish at the end of the semester.
