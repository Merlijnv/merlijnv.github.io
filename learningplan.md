# Learning plan

On this page, I will do the following.

- Describe the skills (technical, procedural, attitude, soft skills) and experience that you want to get this semester.
- Describe your learning wishes and goals for this semester, with a global explanation of the learning activities you are going to do.
- Add a prioritized and planned list of the learning activities. Use this planning to track and manage your progress. Have this list approved by your coach and specialization teacher.

## Skills

I will describe which skills I want to learn this semester. I will not only talk about technical skills. I will also talk about my professional development, procedural and soft skills. Based on these skills, I will start planning.

### Technical skills

This semester I want to do more with red teaming. During my specialization, I have learned a lot of ways to take advantage of security flaws. Even though I have learned all these ways, I still have not much experience to go from enumeration to exploitation and infiltration. I want to practice more boxes on hack the box and learn more ways to make red team hacking easiÃ«r. Furthermore, I am excited to learn how to reverse engineer. I think this has a lot of potentials but never learned how to do it.

### Procedural skills

The procedural skill I want to work on this semester is documentation. I always have a problem with making documentation. I don't have the motivation to make good documentation. I always postpone making documentation or don't take lots of time for it. I think it will be easier to learn on that skill this semester because of the documentation I need to make. Because I will have more motivation when writing writeups of hack the boxes, but I still need to learn how to take more time than I normally do.

### Attitude

<!-- Ik wil dit semester er voor zorgen dat ik meer uit ga van security by design. De veiligheid van internet gerelateerde items wordt een steeds groter topic in de media en wordt hierdoor steeds belangrijk voor bedrijven en overheden. Hierdoor verwacht ik dat werkgevers steeds meer gaan verlangen naar het ontwerpen met de veiligheid als eerste gedachten. -->

"*" is the blue vs red events


The next exercises/challenges are planned for the whole semester because this is part of my R&D project.
S: Look into the security of IoT or OT (e.g. PLC) protocols and technology and find and replay one or more hacks or other security incidents in a test environment. 
C: Contribute to the INTERSECT (Links to an external site.) research by demonstrating known or new attack scenario's in 'Smart Energy' applications, for example in electric vehicle charging networks end endpoints/apps/..., smart energy home applications, and energy systems, etc.

I have prioritized the exercises and challenges I want to do this semester.

### Exercises

1. M: Complete challenges in all categories on different levels in Hack the Box
2. M: Set up your personal toolbox environments for pen-testing and red teaming.
3. S: Learn how to do reversing of smartphone apps (for android, iphone, ...).
4. M: Read about covert channels, find applications of covert channels in hacking and red teaming, and set-up one or several experimental applications of covert channels
5. M: Experiment with phishing tooling in a controlled, separated  environment (do not send phishing mails without a written consent!)
6. M: Find a couple of red teaming and pen-tester vacancies with job descriptions and analyse what task and skills are described. Add to and update your learning plan as needed.
7. S: With a red teaming perspective visit a local building (school, library, store), document your observations AFTERWARDS from a security point of view (people, processes, technology) also reflect on your experience. Act PASSIVELY, don't do anything illegal or anything that could lead to suspicion  or inconvenience: do not make notes or photos, visit rooms you are not supposed to, try fire doors, etc.
8. C: Pick a lock. Study the security of physical locks and pick a lock with a lock picking set.

### Challenges

1. M: Own one of the active Linux based machines in Hack the Box and create a write-up of it, see [1].
2. M: Own one of the active Windows based machines in Hack the Box and create a write-up of it.
3. M: Work on challenge(s) of your personal interest, some ideas are presented during the red-teaming kickoff.
4. M: Prepare towards a Red Team - Blue Team exercise (day/event) with the Security Engineering students and the Blue Team students to attack and test the IT systems and applications developed by the Security Engineering students and the Blue teaming Capabilities of the Blue Teaming students. Test your red teaming skills,  procedures and red team toolbox and environment. Use the experience of the first event to improve your  Red Teaming systems, toolbox, skills, and procedures.
5. M: Set up and perform a pen-test on an (early version of a potentially shippable) product of one of the cyber security R&D project.
6. S: Perform vulnerability analysis on a device (hardware/consumer products). Report your findings through responsible disclosure.
7. S: Perform a vulnerability analysis on a (smartphone) app. Report your findings through responsible disclosure.
8. S: Visit (online, due to COVID-19) seminars or conferences related to red teaming, hacking, relevant tools, etc.
9. S: Look into the security of IoT or OT (e.g. PLC) protocols and technology and find and replay one or more hacks or other security incidents in a test environment. 
10. C: Contribute to the INTERSECT (Links to an external site.) research by demonstrating known or new attack scenario's in 'Smart Energy' applications, for example in electric vehicle charging networks end endpoints/apps/..., smart energy home applications and energy systems, etc.
11. C: Develop a dropbox that can be used in red teaming assignments, see [6] as a first staring point.
12. C: Perform a pen-test on an (early version of a potentially shippable) product of the security engineering students or blue teaming students.
